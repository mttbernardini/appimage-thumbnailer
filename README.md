# Thumbnailer for AppImages

This project will contain a thumbnailer compatible with GNOME and KDE based DEs, to extract icons from AppImages (i.e. `.DirIcon`).

For now a proof of concept is provided in a bash script for GNOME only, using ImageMagick for resizing and the runtime from `AppImageKit`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Write tool in C++ to make it usable by both GNOME and KDE
- [ ] Set up build system and dependencies
- [ ] Set up distro packaging under the name of `appimage-thumbnailer`
